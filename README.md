## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### I'm a student from China, majoring in Computer Science.
But I feel sorry for my learning progress in recent years, cause I wasted a lot of time due to psychological reason, but nerver too late! I am working to build my learn habits and overcome any difficulty I will face during my education journey. Hope to get back on track soon.
